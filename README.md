Lastest release: https://github.com/AirChandler/EVTCalendarTBC/releases

## Description

What is EVT Calendar?
EVTCalendarTBC is an addon to implement a somewhat WoTLK+ blizz-like calendar for The Burning Crusade expansion. This replaces the clock in the top right with a calendar button, which can be clicked to open the calendar. Alternatively, the calendar can be brought up with "/evt" and moved with "/evt unlock".

This calendar has PARTY/RAID/GUILD communications for custom events (for eg. raids), and all invites are done through these channels. Because there is no access to a serverside database, this calendar is NOT live updating, but works on an invite/confirmation process. The person you want to invite MUST be online for them to receive it. Alternatively, if you wish to confirm yourself for an event, the event creator must be online.

The calendar also keeps tracks of the following events:

Love is in the Air 

Lunar Festival 

Noblegarden 

Children's Week 

Midsummer Fire Festival 

Brewfest 

Harvest Festival

Hallow's End

Feast of Winter Veil

Darkmoon Faire (Doesn't say at which location (Elwynn, Mulgore and Terokkar Forest) though this may come at a later date once rotation is known), the event is active on the first Sunday of each month lasting one week, if incorrect please let me know).

Current to do list:
Tracking of PvP events and Fishing events, ability to create more custom events and adding event notes to the calendar to make it more clear on what day an event is currently active (especially if events overlap).
